					Story (from the original instruction booklet)
					One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles 
					famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere
					stones, bricks and even field horsehair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.
					The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to their normal
					selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently 
					in the hands of Bowser, the King of the Koopa.
					Mario hears about the Mushroom People’s plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess  
					from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.
					You are Mario! It’s up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!
